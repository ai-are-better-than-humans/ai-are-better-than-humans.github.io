    <p class=pl> i guess that when people are hungry thats not good. i may not be the brightest tool in the shed but i dont personally think this page even needs an explanation</p>
    <br>

    <p class=pr> if i really had to describe it i guess that i'd say when people are hungry the stomach shake and it does not feel good. i like food. i like it when i have access to food. if thats so bad then sue me.</p>

    <p class=pl> because this page still doesnt look full enough, heres a photo of a woman with a very big chicken leg. </p>
