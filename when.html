    <p class=pl> hopefully right now, but the delivery of the croissants will take a week. so for now we'll compensate by making the only thing i can with the ingredients in my house: <i> a bananadog.</i></p>
    <br>

    <p class=pr> thankfully, i can make over 30 bananadogs in one minute. that gives me a bananadog per second (BPS) of 0.5 thats not too shabby, considering i won the bananadog making contest in 2007. my opponents had a BPS of 0.27 and 0.3, respectively.</p>
    <br>

    <p class=pl> the prize for the championship was an unlimited free pass for pizzas at dominos (they were the sponser) but i threw the coupon away as i only eat banana dogs. at least i had a fun experience and managed to meet the love of my life, my banana-wife.</p>
    <br>

    <p class=pr> Its me and my banana-wife's 3rd anniversary, and i havent regretted a single day. We;re set to have a kid, and i cant wait to rraise him in a world free of hunger.</p>
