    <p class=pl> me and my partner have been kinda puting this off but we have some ideas.</p>

    
    <ul>
      <li> order alot of food from olive garden </li> 
      <li> get food delivered through amazon </li> 
      <li> stay up all night and make croissants </li> 
      <li> make plastic edible </li> 
      <li> ask nicely (for more food)</li> 
      <li> ask jeff bezos for alot of money </li> 
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p class=pr> okay well there are 6.999999999 billion people in the world (rick astley doesnt count) and a pack of 6 croissants on google shopping costs 4$ (side note: who buys crossants from google shopping???)</p>
    <br>

    <p class=pl> anyhow, if we wanted to give each person 20 croissants, that would be the cost of one crossaint (4/6=0.67) times 20 for each person, times 6.999999999 billion. in total, this would set us back 94 billion dollars.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p class=pr> thats probably do-able. we'd just have to like take donations or beg jeffy boy for some money. thats actually pretty reasonable. even if its not enough, we can use the croissants that wouldve gone to switzerland to fill in the gaps.</p>
